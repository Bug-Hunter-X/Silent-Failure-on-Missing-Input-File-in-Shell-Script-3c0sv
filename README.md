# Silent Failure on Missing Input File in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error in shell scripting: silently failing when an input file is missing.  The script attempts to process a file (`my_file.txt`), but it does not handle the case where the file does not exist. This can lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.

The `bug.sh` file contains the buggy script.  The `bugSolution.sh` file shows the corrected version.  The solution uses appropriate error checking to handle the scenario where `my_file.txt` is absent.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in shell scripts to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure reliability.
